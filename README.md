# BookMyMovie
A movie ticket booking system made as a class 12 project for CBSE Board in C++ using (now obsolete) TurboC++. Used graphics.h library for creating the GUI and adding animations in the application.

Screenshots of the working application are located in the Screenshots folder.

You can view it by downloading DosBox from : https://www.dosbox.com/ and then compiling PROJECT.CPP in TurboC++.
