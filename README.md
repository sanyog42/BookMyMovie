# BookMyMovie
A movie ticket booking system made as a class 12 project for CBSE Board in C++ using (now obsolete) TurboC++. Used graphics.h library for creating the GUI and adding animations in the application.

Screenshots of the working application are located in the Screenshots folder.

You can view it by downloading DosBox from : https://www.dosbox.com/ and then compiling PROJECT.CPP in TurboC++.

# Special Instruction for Running in DOS-BOX

1.	It is to be made sure that the file location pointing to the BGI directory in the code is in accordance to the directory where it is installed in the system.
2.	It is to be made sure that the graphics library is properly linked.


I thought of linking it with a online database but dosbox does not support sending even GET data online.
